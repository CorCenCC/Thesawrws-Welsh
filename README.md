# Thesawrws_welsh
This repo introduces an open-access, user-friendly online thesaurus for the Welsh language, aimed at enriching digital resources for Welsh speakers and learners. Utilising advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), our approach combines pre-existing word embeddings, a Welsh semantic tagger, and human evaluation to establish related terms.
